# Customer-Behavior-Analysis
End-to-End Analysis & Visualization
Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow—from loading and exploring raw data to cleaning, transforming, querying with SQL, and visualizing insights using Power BI. The goal is to showcase strong analytical thinking, data handling, SQL proficiency, and dashboard/report-building skills.

 Dataset

The dataset is loaded using Python (Pandas).
It contains information related to [brief description — e.g., sales, customers].

Key actions performed:
Data type inspection
Missing value analysis
Outlier detection
Feature understanding and distribution analysis

Tools & Technologies:
  (Programming & Analysis)
  
Python (Pandas)
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Databases & Querying
PostgreSQL / MySQL 

SQL queries for:
Filtering & sorting
Aggregation
Window functions
Subqueries & CTEs

Visualization & Reporting:
Power BI Dashboard
Report generated using Power BI
PPT/Slides created with Gamma

Steps in the Project:
1. Load Dataset in Python
Imported CSV/Excel data using Pandas.
Displayed initial statistics (head(), info(), describe()).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Checked for missing values
Visualized data distributions
Identified correlations
Performed univariate and bivariate analysis

3. Data Cleaning
Treated missing values (imputation/removal)
Removed duplicates
Handled outliers
Standardized and formatted the data
Prepared a clean dataset for SQL upload

4. SQL Analysis
Uploaded cleaned dataset to database systems:
PostgreSQL
MySQL
SQL Server
Performed analytical queries such as:
Aggregations
Joins between tables
Ranking and window functions
Subqueries
Performance-based filters

5. Power BI Dashboard
Connected the cleaned dataset
Built interactive visuals (charts, KPIs, filters, slicers)
Created a dashboard to highlight key insights
Used DAX for calculated metrics

6. Report Creation
Designed a structured report summarizing insights and recommendations.
Highlighted patterns, trends, and final takeaways.

7. Gamma PPT
Created a clean, presentation-ready slide deck
Included problem statement, methodology, visuals, SQL insights, and dashboard screenshots

 Dashboard Preview
The Power BI dashboard includes:
Key performance indicators (KPIs)
Trend analysis
Category-wise comparisons
Filters/slicers for interactive analysis
Insights summary

Results / Key Insights
Identified trends and patterns in the dataset
Provided actionable insights backed by SQL and visual analysis
Improved understanding of the dataset through EDA
Delivered a dashboard and report for decision-making
